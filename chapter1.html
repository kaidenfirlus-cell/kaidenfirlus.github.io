    <p>
      Show your own completed accurate examples and solutions for each of the following concepts.
      Do not just include snapshots of someone else’s work.
    </p>

<h4>1) Given a Quadratic Equation in the form y = a(x - h)² + k, describe the transformations</h4>
<p>
  Example: y = -2(x - 3)² + 5
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Base function: y = x²</li>
  <li>“a = -2” → Reflects over x-axis and vertically stretches by a factor of 2</li>
  <li>“h = 3” → Translates right 3 units</li>
  <li>“k = 5” → Translates up 5 units</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Final Transformation:</strong> Reflected, stretched, moved right 3, and up 5.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>2) Identify whether or not a relation is a function</h4>
<p>
  A relation is a function if <strong>each x-value has exactly one y-value</strong>.
  In other words, it passes the <strong>Vertical Line Test</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Example:
  <br>Relation 1: {(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)} → <strong>Function</strong> 
  <br>Relation 2: {(1,2), (1,3), (2,4)} → <strong>Not a function</strong> (x = 1 repeats)
</p>

<h4>3) Domain and Range of a Relation</h4>
<p>
  The <strong>domain</strong> is the set of all possible x-values, and the <strong>range</strong> is the set of all possible y-values.
</p>
<p>
  Example: y = x² + 2
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Domain: all real numbers (−∞ &lt; x &lt; ∞)</li>
  <li>Range: y ≥ 2</li>
  <li>
    The vertex (0,2) shows the minimum value of y.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
  Note: Graphs, tables, and mappings can all help determine if a relation is a function and what its domain and range are.

    <h3>Application — Chapter 1</h3>
    <p>
      In quadratic applications, the domain and range are important and relate to real-world situations
      because they define what values are realistic or meaningful within a given context. Every quadratic
      relationship has a set of x-values (the domain) that represent inputs, like time, distance, or
      quantity and corresponding y-values (the range) that represent outputs like height, cost, or area.
    </p>

<p>
  For example, if a quadratic equation models the height of a thrown ball over time, the <strong>domain</strong>
  is limited to the time from when the ball leaves the thrower’s hand until it hits the ground. Negative
  time values or times far beyond landing don’t make physical sense. The <strong>range</strong> represents
  the possible heights the ball reaches, from the ground level (minimum) up to the highest point of the
  throw (maximum).
</p>

<p>
  Understanding domain and range allows us to interpret what the model actually represents. The vertex of
  the parabola often corresponds to a key feature in the real-world scenario: a maximum or minimum point.
  In our example, it would represent the maximum height of the ball. In other contexts, like profit
  analysis, the vertex might represent the best price point or lowest cost.
</p>

<p>
  When solving or graphing quadratics, considering domain and range ensures that results stay
  realistic, focusing only on values that make sense for the situation. This connection between
  mathematics and real-world constraints is what makes quadratic functions powerful tools for modeling
  motion, economics, physics, and countless other scenarios.

    <h3>Quadratic Application: Football Height</h3>
    <p>
      In quadratic applications, the <strong>domain</strong> and <strong>range</strong> are important and relate to real-world contexts.
      Here’s an example problem:
    </p>
    <p>
      A football is thrown into the air. Its height, <em>h(t)</em>, in meters, after <em>t</em> seconds is modeled by:
    </p>
    <p class="equation"><strong>h(t) = -4.9(t - 1.25)² + 9</strong></p>

<h4>A) How high off the ground was the ball when it was thrown?</h4>
<p>
  To find the initial height, substitute <em>t = 0</em>:
</p>
<p>
  h(0) = -4.9(0 - 1.25)² + 9<br>
  h(0) = -4.9(1.5625) + 9 = -7.65625 + 9 = <strong>1.34 m</strong> (approximately)
</p>

<h4>B) What was the maximum height of the football?</h4>
<p>
  The vertex of the parabola gives the maximum height. Since the equation is already in vertex form, the vertex is at
  <strong>(1.25, 9)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  So, the maximum height is <strong>9 meters</strong> at <em>t = 1.25 s</em>.
</p>

<h4>C) How high was the ball after 2.5 seconds?</h4>
<p>
  Substitute <em>t = 2.5</em>:
</p>
<p>
  h(2.5) = -4.9(2.5 - 1.25)² + 9<br>
  h(2.5) = -4.9(1.25)² + 9 = -4.9(1.5625) + 9 = -7.65625 + 9 = <strong>1.34 m</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The ball is about <strong>1.34 meters</strong> high again after 2.5 seconds (symmetric to when it was thrown).
</p>

<h4>D) Is the football in the air after 6 seconds?</h4>
<p>
  Substitute <em>t = 6</em>:
</p>
<p>
  h(6) = -4.9(6 - 1.25)² + 9 = -4.9(4.75)² + 9 = -4.9(22.56) + 9 = -110.5 + 9 = <strong>-101.5</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A negative height means the ball is below ground level, so the football has already hit the ground long before 6 seconds.
  <br><strong>Answer:</strong> No, the football is not in the air after 6 seconds.
</p>

<h4>Domain & Range</h4>
<p>
  - <strong>Domain:</strong> t ≥ 0 and until the ball hits the ground (roughly 2.5 s)<br>
  - <strong>Range:</strong> 0 ≤ h(t) ≤ 9
