            <h4>1) Solving a Quadratic Equation by Graphing</h4>
            <p>To solve a quadratic by graphing, plot its function and locate where it crosses the x-axis. These x-intercepts correspond to the equation’s zeros or roots. If the parabola doesn’t cross the axis, it has no real solutions.</p>

            <h4>2) Solving a Quadratic Equation by Factoring</h4>
            <p>Rewrite the quadratic in factored form. Then, apply the zero product property: if (x − r₁)(x − r₂) = 0, then x = r₁ or x = r₂. This is an efficient algebraic method when factoring is possible with integer or rational roots.</p>

            <p>
              In quadratic applications, the zeros are crucial because they often represent meaningful real-world events, such as when an object lands, a projectile returns to the ground, or profit equals zero.
              Understanding zeros allows us to interpret when and where key moments happen, linking mathematics to real-life behavior and predictions.

            <h3>Quadratic Problem — Rock Thrown from a Cliff</h3>
            <p>A rock is thrown from the top of a cliff on an uncharted planet. Its height above the surface is modeled by <strong>h(t) = -8t² + 10t + 25</strong>, where t is time (seconds) and h(t) is height (metres).</p>

            <h4>A) When will the rock reach its maximum height?</h4>
            <p>Since a = -8 (negative), the parabola opens downward, meaning it has a maximum point at its vertex. Using the formula <em>t = -b / (2a)</em>:</p>
            <p class="equation"><strong>t = -10 / (2 × -8) = 10 / 16 = 0.625 seconds.</strong></p>

            <h4>B) What is the maximum height?</h4>
            <p>Substitute t = 0.625 into h(t):</p>
            <p class="equation">
              h(0.625) = -8(0.625)² + 10(0.625) + 25 = -8(0.3906) + 6.25 + 25 = -3.125 + 31.25 = <strong>28.125 metres</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>Therefore, the rock reaches its <strong>maximum height of 28.125 metres</strong> at <strong>t = 0.625 seconds</strong> after being thrown.</p>
